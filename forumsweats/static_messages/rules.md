**RULES**

ðŸ”· Excessive harassment of other members is strictly disallowed, as are threats. Please be respectful of other members and use proper pronouns. Do not excessively mock users, even if they are not in this Discord. If you see someone violate this rule, please report them in a ticket. 

ðŸ”· We allow swearing, but any use of slurs is not allowed. Please refrain from any forms of racism, sexism, or any other type of bigotry.

ðŸ”· No spamming. This includes sending many unwanted or unnecessary messages, or a few extremely long and "spammy" messages. This includes spamming images, videos, and all forms of messages. If you intend to send many memes or videos, do it in the shitposting channel.
        ðŸ”¹  This includes spamming reactions

ðŸ”· Please refrain from spam pinging other members, unless specifically told by that user that you may.

ðŸ”· Absolutely no NSFW content of any sort. This includes sexual, vile, and gory content. Links to this type of content also counts. If you have to ask if it's okay, assume it isn't.

ðŸ”· Absolutely no DDoS/Doxx threats or unwanted leaking of personal info in any way. Even if it's something as basic as sharing somebody's private steam, that is still forbidden.

ðŸ”· No IP grabbers, viruses, or any other dangerous links/files. If you are going to send a file, say what it is ahead of time.

ðŸ”· No punishment evasion via alts or VPNs.

ðŸ”· Impersonation with harmful intent is not allowed. This counts people not in the server, or people not even on discord. 

ðŸ”· Follow the Discord TOS & Community Guidelines.

ðŸ”· Don't promote breaking rules. This includes the Hypixel rules and our rules.

ðŸ”· Keep threads on topic. 

ðŸ”· Have common sense. Just because it isn't explicitly listed here doesn't make it allowed. If you are told by staff to stop, then you stop.

ðŸ”· Staff are free to carry out ANY punishment they see fit. If you think you were punished unfairly, create a private ticket in tickets and CALMLY explain what happened. Screenshots are helpful.
